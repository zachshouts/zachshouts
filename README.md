# Hello!

I'm Zach Shouts, a Full Stack Developer with a versatile background in all things coding. I am currently looking for a role, but in the meantime, I am building on my skills and learning whatever I can to become a more experienced developer.


## Experience

I began my programming journey at Lake Superior College in 2020 before transferring to a Full Stack Development program through through the University of Minnesota in December of 2022. Over the past 3 years I've had the pleasure of working with many different programming languages, and although my github only showcases HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, MySQL, and Python, I do have a very good foundational knowledge of Java, C#, and PHP.
